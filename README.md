# Learning rule-based phonology from speech sound signals

## Abstract
As part of language acquisition, the child receives a lot of sound signals, he interprets those speech sounds and associates them to sounds he has already heard. After creating some cognitive representations to these speech sounds, he starts to form cognitive system which describes the way sounds function within the heard language (i.e. phonology of the language) to encode meaning in the future. In this paper we try to imitate this learning procedure artificially, using a computer code. This learning process works as follows. It starts with a recorded speech sounds, which it classifies using MDL classifier into main groups that represent language components. Then it uses MDL-based algorithm to learn some simple phonological rules, like vowel harmony, from the processed input.
